    <h2>HTTP1.1: Request-Response Model</h2>
    <p>HTTP1.1 uses a request-response model. When a client requests a resource from a server, the server sends a response that includes the requested resource. However, this model can lead to increased latency and slower page loads as the number of requests increases.</p>

    <h2>HTTP2: Multiplexing Model</h2>
    <p>HTTP2 revolutionized data transfer with multiplexing. It allows multiple requests to be sent and received in parallel over a single connection. This leads to faster and more efficient data transfer, reducing latency and enhancing web performance.</p>

    <h2>Header Compression for Efficiency</h2>
    <p>In HTTP1.1, headers are sent with each request and response, adding overhead to each transaction. HTTP2 utilizes header compression, reducing the size of headers and speeding up data transfers. This enhancement significantly improves efficiency and reduces the payload size exchanged between the client and server.</p>

    <h2>Server Push for Faster Page Loads</h2>
    <p>HTTP2 introduces server push, a game-changer in web performance. With server push, the server can proactively send resources to the client without waiting for explicit requests. This optimizes page loading times, as the client doesn't have to wait for each resource to be requested before loading. It creates a more responsive and seamless user experience.</p>

    <h2>Single Connection for Improved Efficiency</h2>
    <p>In HTTP1.1, multiple connections are established for each resource requested
