    <h1>Understanding Objects in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs. It can hold any type of value such as numbers, strings, or other objects.</p>

    <p>An object is defined using curly braces <code>{}</code> and can have properties and methods. Properties are variables that hold values, and methods are functions that are associated with an object.</p>

    <h2>Internal Representation of Objects in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript are created using a special data type called "object." When an object is created, JavaScript internally creates a reference to the object and stores it in memory. The reference is a unique identifier for the object, and it allows us to access and modify the properties and methods of the object.</p>

    <p>Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, which means that you can add or remove properties and methods from an object at any time. When you add a new property to an object, JavaScript internally creates a new memory location to store the value of the property.</p>

    <p>Objects in JavaScript are also mutable, which means that you can change the values of the properties of an object. When you change the value of a property, JavaScript internally updates the memory location of the property to hold the new value.</p>

    <h2>Passing Objects in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, objects are passed by reference, not by value. This means that when you pass an object as an argument to a function or assign an object to a variable, a reference to the object is passed or assigned, not a copy of the object.</p>

    <h2>Example of an Object in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Let's consider an example of a laptop object:</p>
    <pre><code>const laptop = {
  brand: "Dell",
  model: "Inspiron",
  color: "Silver",
  RAM: "8GB",
  storage: "512GB SSD",
  turnOn: function() {
    console.log("Laptop is turning on...");
  },
  turnOff: function() {
    console.log("Laptop is turning off...");
  }
};</code></pre>

    <p>The laptop object has properties such as brand, model, color, RAM, and storage, and methods called turnOn() and turnOff(). You can access these properties and methods using dot notation (e.g., <code>laptop.brand</code>) or bracket notation (e.g., <code>laptop['brand']</code>).</p>
